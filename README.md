(Because Google can't diagnose leaf drama)
This GIS-based system predicts plant diseases using spatial data and environmental factors, providing early warnings and insights to farmers for better crop management.

### INTRDUCTION:
Plant diseases significantly impact global food security, making early detection crucial for preventing crop losses. This project leverages Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to predict plant diseases by analyzing spatial data, satellite imagery, soil conditions, and environmental factors. By mapping disease-prone areas and identifying geographic trends, the system provides early warnings and actionable insights to farmers. This enhances decision-making, optimizes resource allocation, and supports sustainable agriculture. To maximize accessibility, the platform will be available in multiple local languages, ensuring farmers in remote areas receive accurate disease forecasts and timely interventions, ultimately improving crop health and yields.

### SOLUTION:
Empowering farmers with AI-driven plant disease detection, this project enhances agricultural productivity through better decision-making. By combining remote sensing, AI, and GIS, it enables accurate disease forecasting and early identification using geospatial data. Providing real-time insights, the system helps mitigate crop losses, improve food security, and revolutionize precision agriculture with smart, location-based disease monitoring.
